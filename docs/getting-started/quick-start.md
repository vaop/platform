# Quick Start

Get VAOP running in just a few minutes.

## What You'll Need

- Web hosting with PHP 8.4+ and MySQL/MariaDB (most shared hosting works)
- A domain or subdomain pointed to your hosting

## Steps

1. **Download** the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vaop/platform/releases)

2. **Upload** the files to your hosting via File Manager or FTP

3. **Create a database** in your hosting control panel

4. **Point your domain** to the `public` folder

5. **Visit your site** in a browser to run the setup wizard

That's it! The setup wizard will walk you through the rest.
